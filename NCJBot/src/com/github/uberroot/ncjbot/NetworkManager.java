/**
 * <p>This class keeps track of other nodes within the network. The nodes within a network only know of each
 * others status through direct communication. Network updates are not currently relayed to other nodes; rather a node
 * figures out the status of a remote node when it needs something from that remote node. The network manager maintains a timer
 * to rebroadcast its presence to the rest of the network. This allows the network to recover this node
 * in the event a connection error resulted in this node being removed from the active list of other nodes.
 * Currently, this timer is set to announce the presence of the node once per hour (non-configurable).</p>
 * 
 * <p>Currently, there is little functionality regarding monitoring node network health; remote node health is implemented using a lazy algorithm.
 * Nodes alert all other nodes when they join the network. Any time one node needs something from another node, it will try to connect. If
 * it is unsuccessful, it will be assumed to be down. This only changes the internal state of the requesting node; other nodes will need to
 * learn of such failures on their own. In order to remedy situations in which nodes are falsely assumed down (i.e. due to an unstable network),
 * all nodes broadcast their presence to all nodes known.</p>
 * <br>
 * 
 * <b>NOTE: THIS NEXT SECTION HAS NOT YET BEEN IMPLEMENTED / MAY NOT BE IMPLEMENTED AS DESCRIBED</b>
 * <p>The NetworkManager allows for two modes of operation: "Full" and "Gossip".</p>
 * 
 * <p>In full mode, this node will establish its presence with ALL other nodes. All network change messages will be broadcast
 * to the entire network. Each node running under full mode that receives a change message will either repeat the message to
 * the rest of the network, or discard the message if it is already aware of the change (preventing a flood).
 * This mode of operation is intended for smaller networks, as it can create a great deal of traffic. The primary
 * objective of this mode is to create a minimal delay between the time a network change occurs and the time
 * the entire network compensates for the event. This mode may not be implemented.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Under gossip mode, the initial presence announcement will only be made to a random subset of nodes, the number of which is configurable (or may be fixed at 2).
 * Message broadcasts will then be relayed to a random subset of nodes within the network, the size of which is configurable (or may be fixed at 2).
 * Each receiving node running in gossip mode will then relay the message to another random subset of the network,
 * or discard the message if it is already aware of the event. A more structured implementation may be used to form links between the
 * nodes that are always used rather than select a new random subset on each relay, creating a more consistent network structure.
 * A variation of this mode will likely be implemented.</p>
 * 
 * 
 * <p>Under either mode, messages are relayed at a configurable rate. Propagation may either stop after a TTL expiration or utilize an event resolution technique that may work as follows:
 * <ul>
 * 	<li>If a node receives information on a node and has never received the type of data before, assume it's correct and propagate.</li>
 * 	<li>If a node receives information on a node and has identical information, assume it's correct and ignore.</li>
 * 	<li>If a node receives information on a node and the information conflicts with current information and the new information has a later timestamp, assume it's correct and propagate.</li>
 * 	<li>If a node receives information on a node and the information conflicts with current information and the new information has an earlier timestamp, assume it's incorrect and propagate the correct information only to the node that sent the incorrect information.</li> 
 * </ul>
 * A method for synchronization still needs to be developed.</p>
