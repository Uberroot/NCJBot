Please note that while the API for developing applications atop the framework is fairly stable, the platform
is undergoing internal changes, including a shift towards a modular plugin-based design.

This project is still in a proof-of-concept stage, so run it in a controlled environment and expect things to change.
A lot of powerful features are coming!
